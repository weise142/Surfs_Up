# Surfs_Up
## Project Overview
The purpose of this project is to review weather patterns in Hawaii to assist W Avy in determining whether a Surf and Ice Cream Shop is a good business idea. Specifically, we are focusing on weather in the months of June and December in Oahu to determine if weather conditions would create a viable year-round business. With this information, W Avy can make a more informed business decision.
## Results
### June Temperatures
The below table summarizes the temperature in June In Oahu

### December Temperatures
The below table summarized the temperature in December in Oahu

These tables tell us a lot about the year round temperature patterns in Oahu:
- Average temperature in June and December are 75 and 71 respectively. This illustrates a fairly constant high temperature in Oahu throughout the year.
- Maximum temperatures in June and December are 85 and 83 degrees respectively. Again, this shows little fluctuation in temperatures throughout the year.
- Minimum temperature in June and December are 64 and 56 degrees respectively. Although the difference between these tenmperatures is the largest amongst the summary statistics, it further illustrates a lack of fluctuation in temperatures and the continually warm temperatures Oahu experiences throughout the year.
## Summary
Based on the information from June and December, temperatures are stable year-round in Oahu. Although only based on a single piece of weather data, the stability of temperatures in Oahu year-round means W Avy's idea for a Surf and Ice Cream Shop is a viable business idea.
Additional queries that could be performed on the weather data could be precipitation differences between June and December to determine if there is a rainy season for Oahu. This could be imporant I am assuming that people generally dont want to surf or get ice cream in the rain. We could look at differences in the UV index between June and December to determine if there is a difference throughout the year in the intensity of UV radiation(Sunshine) from the sun. This may be important because higher UV Index may mean less time outdoors, although this could be a boon to business. Another query we could look at is wave heights. This is self explanatory as wave heights would determine the willingness of surfers to be out in the water and understanding how this differs throughout the year could mean a large loss or gain in business.
